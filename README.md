NOTE: you will need to download game.html AND feynman.jpg AND guessing_game.js files. You will need to make sure they are all in the same directory before opening game.html or the page will not load properly!

The game prompts you for Craig's favorite scientist.  If you get it correct, it dispays one message in an alert :  "Wowza! You got it!".  If you guess incorrectly, it displays "No, but here's comes a hint... Click the button. Then refresh the browser and try again!" in an alert.   You can then click the button to see a picture of the scientist. Then if you refresh your browser, you can guess again!

NOTE: you can keep clicking the button over and over to fill the page up with the picture!  However, these images disappear when you refresh the page, and you'll have to click again to make them appear.

We changed the game so the user guesses the names of two scientists pictured.  For each correct answer, the player gets 1 point.  At the end, the points earned and the total number of points possible are displayed.
